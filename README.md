This project - lovingly titled Overcomplicated Calculator - serves as the starting point for a skills development workshop that will be hosted by WECS starting in Spring 2026.

The goal of the workshop is for students with some programming experience to learn the basics of React and Flask! In this example we use React to build a very basic calculator and send all of our calculations to the Flask back end.
While this isn't necessary, and we can do all of these calculations in JavaScript, it serves as an introductory example for how to set up a front and back end, and how to connect them!
